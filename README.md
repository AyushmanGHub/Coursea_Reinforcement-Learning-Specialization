# Reinforcement Learning Specialization
The **Reinforcement Learning Specialization** on Coursera is a comprehensive 4-course program designed to equip learners with the theoretical foundations and practical skills needed to build powerful reinforcement learning systems. Developed by experts, this specialization covers key topics such as Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, function approximation, policy gradient methods, and advanced control techniques. The capstone project brings all concepts together, enabling learners to design, implement, and optimize a complete reinforcement learning agent to solve a challenging real-world problem.
